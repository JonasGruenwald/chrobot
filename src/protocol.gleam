//// > ⚙️  This module was generated from the Chrome DevTools Protocol version **1.3**
//// For reference: [See the DevTools Protocol API Docs](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/1-3/)
//// 
//// This is the protocol definition entrypoint, it contains an overview of the protocol structure,
//// and a function to retrieve the version of the protocol used to generate the current bindings.  
//// The protocol version is also displayed in the box above, which appears on every generated module.  
//// 
//// ## ⚠️ Really Important Notes
////    
//// 1) It's best never to work with the DOM domain for automation, 
//// [an explanation of why can be found here](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/pull/71#issuecomment-314599749).  
//// Instead, to automate DOM interaction, JavaScript can be injected using the Runtime domain.
////   
//// 2) Unfortunately, I haven't found a good way to map dynamic properties to gleam attributes bidirectionally.  
//// **This means all dynamic values you supply to commands will be silently dropped**!  
//// It's important to realize this to avoid confusion, for example in `runtime.call_function_on` 
//// you may want to supply arguments which can be any value, but it won't work.  
//// The only path to do that as far as I can tell, is write the protocol call logic yourself,
//// perhaps taking the codegen code as a basis.  
//// Check the `call_custom_function_on` function from `chrobot` which does this for the mentioned function
//// 
//// ## Structure
//// 
//// Each domain in the protocol is represented as a module under `protocol/`. 
//// 
//// In general, the bindings are generated through codegen, directly from the JSON protocol schema [published here](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol), 
//// however there are some little adjustments that needed to be made, to make the protocol schema usable, mainly due to
//// what I believe are minor bugs in the protocol.  
//// To see these changes, check the `apply_protocol_patches` function in `chrobot/internal/generate_bindings`.
//// 
//// Domains may depend on the types of other domains, these dependencies are mirrored in the generated bindings where possible.
//// In some case, type references to other modules have been replaced by the respective inner type, because the references would
//// create a circular dependency.
//// 
//// ## Types 
//// 
//// The generated bindings include a mirror of the type defitions of each type in the protocol spec,
//// alongside with an `encode__` function to encode the type into JSON in order to send it to the browser
//// and a `decode__` function in order to decode the type out of a payload sent from the browser. Encoders and
//// decoders are marked internal and should be used through command functions which are described below.
//// 
//// Notes:  
//// - Some object properties in the protocol have the type `any`, in this case the value is considered as dynamic
//// by decoders, and encoders will not encode it, setting it to `null` instead in the payload
//// - Object types that don't specify any properties are treated as a `Dict(String,String)` 
//// 
//// Additional type definitions and encoders / decoders are generated, 
//// for any enumerable property in the protocol, as well as the return values of commands.  
//// These special type definitions are marked with a comment to indicate 
//// the fact that they are not part of the protocol spec, but rather generated dynamically to support the bindings.
//// 
//// 
//// ## Commands
//// 
//// A function is generated for each command, named after the command (in snake case).  
//// The function handles both encoding the parameters to sent to the browser via the protocol, and decoding the response.
//// A `ProtocolError` error is returned if the decoding fails, this would mean there is a bug in the protocol
//// or the generated bindings.
//// 
//// The first parameter to the command function is always a `callback` of the form
//// 
//// ```gleam
//// fn(method: String, parameters: Option(Json)) -> Result(Dynamic, RequestError)
//// ```
//// 
//// By using this callback you can take advantage of the generated protocol encoders/decoders 
//// while also passing in your browser subject to direct the command to, and passing along additional
//// arguments, like the `sessionId` which is required for some operations.
////
